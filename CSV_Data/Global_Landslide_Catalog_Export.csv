When you take a drive by Glenwood Cemetery, you'll undoubtedly notice the beautiful scenery on top of the hill. But when you take a glance down the hill, you'll now see this. Glenwood President Ginger Klenk says, ""It was kind of a shock to see that because nothing like this apparently has ever happened before."" And while the heavy amounts of rainfall caused this physical damage, cemetery officials say the roughly 2–3,000 grave sites remain mostly unharmed. Klenk says, ""I don't think they need to worry about anything. As you can see, this is just an open area, there are no graves and never will be on the slope part.""

Highway engineers say damage to KY 93 between the 8 and 9 mile marker south of Eddyville is so serious the project is more about rebuilding the roadway rather than repairing it.  The heavy rain that lead to near-record flooding across the region saturated the soil causing the roadway to drop as much as 10 feet along about a 1500-foot section of highway in the Eddy Creek area.  Early estimates indicate the cost of repair will be about $600,000.  This week, a contractor that specializes in landslide repair has drilled and placed steel posts into the slide area to help stabilize the soil.  Starting Monday the crew will drive pilings along the lower edge of the slide to further stabilize the area.  Once a retaining wall is constructed, the area will be back filled and compacted to help reduce the possibility of future slides","KY 93, at mile marker 8-9(?), between Eddyville and Eddy Creek, Lyon county, KY",5km,landslide,downpour,small,unknown,0,,,,,glc,3412,United States,US,Kentucky,2554,Eddyville,7.88518,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-88.0267,37.0379

The accident happened at about 8 am in a coal mine in the town of Dawu in Luliang City, which unleashed 300,000 cubic meters of mud and rocks to push the boiler house some 20 meters away, trapping five workers, according to rescuers.  Among them, four died on the scene and one died after being sent to the hospital. Rescue efforts ended at Thursday noon.  More than 400 rescuers dug through the debris, trying to retrieve trapped workers.  The landslide was apparently triggered by heavy rainfall in the region, which caused direct economic losses of more than 4.8 million yuan (US$ 738,500), according to the rescue command center.

Fortunately the rockslide only caused a slowing of traffic along the coastal area as only one side of the road was blocked.

However, some residents have decided to leave for fear that a much bigger slide is on its way.  Geologists went to the site Tuesday morning to check the hill's stability. Crews say the hill is unstable, but there is no indication that there would be a massive slide.  Monday night's slide brought down several small trees and caused some damage to the roof of the garage.  Crews have roped off a section of land near the slide. The manager of a nearby apartment complex says he put up a large tarp on his property in early January to prevent a washout.

Highway 99, south of Salmon Creek, WA","Torrential rains over the weekend are being blamed for a landslide that has undermined one lane of Highway 99 south of Salmon Creek.  Clark County road crews on Monday closed one southbound lane at least until next week, giving them enough time to shore up 25 feet of embankment. Officials expect the repair will cost about $150,000.  “We need to re-establish the integrity of the slope,” said Greg Shafer, operations manager for Clark County Public Works.  Shafer said the lane may remain closed until the end of next week. Additional lane restrictions are possible during paving and repairs.  The highway includes two lanes in each direction, with a center turn lane.  Officials suspect stormwater runoff from heavy rain on Sunday flowed through old guardrail post holes on the west side of the highway, triggering the landslide. A nearby business reported the issue on Monday, prompting the lane closure.  The nearest business is Pioneer Fence, Deck and Supply Co., 11318 N.E. Highway 99. ","near 11318 N.E.

ÒThese are the most dangerous landslides, but they often go undetected.Ó Stark is working to change that. Along with colleague G_ran Ekstr_m, he has pioneered a new method to detect landslides by analyzing seismic waves -- the vibrations that radiate through EarthÕs crust because of sudden movements of rock, ice, magma, or debris.

The steep slope on 29th Street Court Northwest near Shawnee Drive gave way around 1:30 am., causing hundreds of yards of dirt and mud to crash into the garage of a two-story home.","Gig Harbor, Washington",1km,mudslide,downpour,small,unknown,0,,,,,glc,1302,United States,US,Washington,12653,Artondale,2.93762,04/01/2014 12:00:00 AM,11/20/2017 03:17:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,-122.6522,47.2841

Most probably have never noticed a small landslide that has been occurring there for years.  The landslide is about two miles west-northwest of McCaslin Road, between Superior and Boulder. Geologists say landslides are common and form a lot around Colorado.  ""A landslide is just a movement of earth. It is like an avalanche. But, instead of snow, you have dirt,"" said James Hagadorn, the curator of geology for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.  ""It happens because it's sliding downhill. It's heavier, and it's slippery. It's like a bar of soap on a board, you wet that board, and that soap is going to slide down,"" he said.  The landslide has recently been repaired. Hagadorn says that there are several engineering techniques that can be used to help stabilize it. And the best way to keep people safe is to monitor it, which geologists and engineers do regularly.

The PWD is making efforts to resume the movement of pilgrims on trek which is blocked since Friday when landslides hit the trek damaging it. However, they said, it might take a couple of days more to make the trek fit for movement of pilgrims. The alternative trek route to Kedarnath is very narrow making it dangerous for pilgrims to use it, they added. Kedarnath, which is among the four Himalayan shrines collectively known as Chardham, is situated at a height of 3581 meter in Garhwal Himalayas.

Two falling boulders—maintenance workers on the scene said the largest was about 10 feet by 11 feet—dented and cracked the pavement.

A landslide has occurred at the 27th km of the Lankaran-Lerik highway in Azerbajan.   The landslide is believed to have been caused by days of rainfall in the region. The mud coming down from the mountains reached the highway, causing difficulty in the movement of vehicles. The highway’s upper lay also slid. As a result, part of the highway has narrowed.   A concerned official said in a statement to APA that heavy machinery and manpower have been sent to the site to repair the damaged part of the highway.",27th km of the Lankaran-Lerik highway in Azerbajan.,25km,landslide,rain,small,below_road,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,07/11/2017 02:24:00 PM,12/05/2017 04:34:00 PM,02/15/2018 03:51:00 PM,48.644237,38.73273
