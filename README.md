# Project Background
As of recent, the accurate prediction and/or prompt detection of landslides has become of larger interest within the field of machine learning. Extensive research has been conducted primarily within the fields of landslide prediction and aerial detection, while prompt real-time detection has had minimal advancement. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially in the sub-field of computer vision have opened a wide range of opportunities for the development of relatively small but potent models attuned specifically for accurate real-time detection. The chosen model architecture of the proposed project is a Convolutional Neural Network based primarily for its proven effectiveness at both image and video analysis. By building a CNN and training it on a specially curated dataset of images that are sourced from highway live feeds (with the addition of landslide laden examples) the proposed system can easily identify landslide events or other such anomalies that differ from “normal” traffic conditions. Additionally, integrating this technology into a desktop application available for Windows will allow for the easy deployment of centralized landslide monitoring and management. Users responsible for system monitoring are also provided the tools to control and customize the detection process alongside the aid of supplementary data such as localized severe weather alerts.
